**shapefile** = A vector data storage format for storing the location, shape, and attributes of geographic features. A shapefile is stored in a set of related files and contains one feature class.

**geoJSON** =  GeoJson is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation.

**layer** = The visual representation of a geographic dataset in any digital map environment. Conceptually, a layer is a slice or stratum of the geographic reality in a particular area, and is more or less equivalent to a legend item on a paper map. On a road map, for example, roads, national parks, political boundaries, and rivers might be considered different layers.

**basemap** = A basemap is a background georeferenced image that gives a point of reference on a map. Basemaps are non-editable and provides aesthetic appeal such as aerial imagery, topography, terrain and street layers.

**feature** = A representation of a real-world object on a map.

**feature layer** = A layer that references a set of feature data. Feature data represents geographic entities as points, lines, and polygons.

**REST** = Acronym for Representational State Transfer. An architecture for exchanging information between peers in a decentralized, distributed environment. REST allows programs on different computers to communicate independently of an operating system or platform by sending a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to a uniform resource locator (URL) and getting back data in some formatfor example, XML, or inside a URL. REST is used in Web services.

**spatial query** = A statement or logical expression that selects geographic features based on location or spatial relationship. For example, a spatial query might find which points are contained within a polygon or set of polygons, find features within a specified distance of a feature, or find features that are adjacent to each other.

**geocoding** = A GIS operation for converting street addresses into spatial data that can be displayed as features on a map, usually by referencing address information from a street segment data layer.
